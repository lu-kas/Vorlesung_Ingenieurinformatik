    "## Idea of the 'Data Analysis with Python' course\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "- often the capturing of data is presented and the results are discussed\n",
    "- the results do not just come out of the aparatus or the simulation, but involve (massive) post-processing of the raw data, which is not shown\n",
    "- this course shall close the gap\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "- focus lies on getting YOU started to be able to do analysis by YOURSELF (of eventually YOUR data)\n",
    "- no deep introduction into analysis methods, but focus on how to work with them in Python\n",
    "- Linh, Max and I will only guide you, but you have to work by yourselfs [this doesn't mean you have to work alone, so team up!]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimer\n",
    "- we will not provide any/an extensive documentation, all you need is already in the internet and we help you to find it – and yes, you have to read documentations during the excercises\n",
    "- this course is a new concept, open for everybody and taught the first time by us: please help us to make it better, by constructive feedback and be patient with us debugging the exercises ;-)\n",
    "- this course is meant for beginners, if you are an expert: stay and give it a try to do advanced analysis!\n",
    "- this course will grant you no credit points, if you see benefit for students to participate, we will try to include it in future accreditations"
