    "## For Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "`for` loops are traditionally used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times. The structure of a `for` loop consists of a iteration variable, a set of elements, which will be looped over, and the loop body. The body is the part that will be repeated for each element of the iteration set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Blocks\n",
    "Many other programming languages use brackets to indicate groups of code, like the body of a for loop. Python used indentations to group lines of code. Use a tab to create new block.\n",
